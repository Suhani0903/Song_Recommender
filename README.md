🎵 Song Recommendation System

A Python-based web app built with Streamlit that recommends songs by analyzing lyrics. 
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like TF–IDF vectorization
and cosine similarity to suggest songs with similar lyrical content. Additionally, it provides 
visualizations of lyric patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn, making music discovery more interactive and insightful.
